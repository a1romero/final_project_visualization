                        After looking at the United States as a whole, we decided to further investigate some states in the midwest with high chemical use.  This region is typically associated with agriculture, and nicknamed “The Corn Belt” due to its prevalent production of corn. In fact, farms and ranchland in this area accounted for 27% of the agricultural output in the United States in 2020.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We chose to investigate both the Corn Belt and its surrounding states, due to the high volume of chemical usage in the region. For example, on our state map, Texas was indicated to have high amounts of chemical use. This can be explained by the large agricultural industry in Texas, for it was the 4th highest ranked agricultural producing state by cash receipts in 2021 by the USDA (behind California, Iowa, and Nebraska).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After including surrounding states with significant agricultural output, our dataset consisted of Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota,  Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Texas. Based upon the availability of data, we found that the most granular method was to look at individual counties in each state.

                        <i>No chemical data found for Lake and Cook counties in Minnesota. A total of 14 data points for personal income were removed due to discrepancies between data sources. More information on the data can be found on the <a href = "about.html">about page</a>.</i>

                        The counties displaying the highest amount of acres treated are located in eastern North Dakota, such as Cass and Cavalier County, and the western region of Minnesota, such as Polk and Marshall County. In these counties, herbicide accounts for the largest portion of chemical use in agriculture. This suggests that these areas struggle with weeds (perhaps due to the scale of their productions). The environmental effect of herbicide use may be a decrease in biodiversity in their corresponding aquatic ecosystems. Cass County in North Dakota possesses the highest amount of acres treated with chemicals at 2.4 million acres. Its personal income per capita is $54,196, which is slightly higher than the national average based on our state data. This is similar to Cavalier County with the next highest chemical use in the state (2.2 million acres treated) since its personal income also lies above the national average. Personal income data relating to North Dakota roughly affirms our hypothesis, as the majority of counties who treat more than a million acres with chemicals fall below the national average personal income in 2017.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The county with lowest amount of chemical usage is Ramsey County in Minnesota with a value of 182 acres treated. In this area, fertilizer takes up the largest portion of the chemical type distribution, indicating that this area may experience poor soil health. The personal income per capita in this county is $52,291. This helps support our hypothesis, as this value is above the national average denoted in our state plot on the home page. In Minnesota overall it is apparent that many of the counties fall below the national average personal income, especially when the total amount of acres treated with chemicals increases. Our hypothesis is validated as a result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A similar interpretation can be made in Illinois, the state marked with the second highest chemical use. Almost all of the data points with regards to personal income fall below the national average, and the few counties above it have relatively less acres treated. In general, low income populations are located in areas with high chemical use. Iroquois County used the most chemicals within the state, with 1.4 million total acres treated. Its personal income per capita of $41,365 is below the national average. This county, much like the previous counties mentioned, uses herbicides the most. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many counties with very high chemical use, such as the ones noted above, have a high percentage of herbicide use like the overall United States. This may be due to the fact that this region accounts for much of U.S. agricultural output, and therefore contributes significantly to the nation’s total herbicide use, making it the most used chemical nationally.

                        With regards to income, states that are interesting to analyze are South Dakota and Iowa. With these states, many counties above the national average income line use a medium amount of chemicals relative to the state. Many countries below the national average income are noted with little chemical use. For these two states, it is only the extreme values in chemical use, like Spink and Brown County in North Dakota, and Pottawattamie and Kossuth County in Iowa, that show a clear correlation with income below the national average. Other factors outside of agriculture and chemical use may explain this.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, this visualization demonstrates that the majority of counties in the middle strip of the United States follow the trend that the most popular chemical used in the agricultural industry is herbicide. Our hypothesis was mostly validated as well, since the majority of data points relating to personal income in all of these states known for agriculture or high chemical use fall below the national average personal income.
