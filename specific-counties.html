                        After looking at the United States as a whole, we decided to further investigate some states in the midwest indicated with high chemical use.  The overall region is typically associated with agriculture, and nicknamed “The Corn Belt” due to its prevalent production of corn and soybeans. In fact, farms and ranchland in this area accounted for 27% of the agricultural output in the United States in 2020. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also took note that Texas on our state map was indicated to have high amounts of chemical use. This can be explained by the large agricultural industry in Texas, for it was the 4th highest ranked agricultural producing state in 2021 by the USDA (behind California, Iowa, and Nebraska). The state also accounts for the highest percentage of U.S. farms, and in 2019 accounted for 8.6% of the state’s total GDP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We included states surrounding Texas as well to provide an overall visualization that looks at the middle strip of the United States. The overall process resulted in the visualization analyzing Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota,  Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Texas. Based upon the availability of data, we found that the most granular method was to look at individual counties in each of these states.

                        The counties displaying the highest amount of acres treated in this context are located in eastern North Dakota, such as Cass and Cavalier county, and the western region of Minnesota, such as Polk and Marshall County. In these counties herbicide accounts for the largest portion of chemical use in agriculture, which may suggest these areas struggle with weeds due to the scale of their productions. In turn, the potential environmental effect may be a decrease in biodiversity in their corresponding aquatic ecosystems. Cass county in North Dakota possesses the highest amount of acres treated with chemicals, that being 2,406,363. Its personal income per capita is $54,196, which is slightly higher than the national average based on our state data. This is similar to Cavalier county with the next highest chemical use since it’s personal income also lies above the national average. The personal income data relating to North Dakota overall roughly affirms our hypothesis however, as the majority of counties who treat more than a million acres with chemicals fall below the national average personal income in 2017.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The county with lowest amount of chemical usage is Ramsey County in Minnesota with a value of 182 acres treated. In this area, fertilizer takes up a larger proportion of the chemical type distribution, indicating that this area may experience poor soil health. The personal income per capita in this county is $52,291. This helps support our hypothesis, as this value is above the national average denoted in our State plot on the home page. In Minnesota overall it is apparent that many of the counties fall below the national average personal income, especially when the total amount of acres treated with chemicals increases. Our hypothesis is validated as a result.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A similar interpretation can be made in Illinois, the state marked with the highest chemical use. Almost all of the data points with regards to personal income fall below the national average, with only the very few who are above it have a relatively lower amount of acres treated with chemicals compared to the other points. Therefore, low income populations are located in areas with high chemical use in this state.  A notable data point in Illinois relates to Iroquois county. In 2017 it had 1445070 total acres treated, but has a personal income per capita of $41365, which is below the national average at the state level. This county, much like the previous counties mentioned, uses herbicide the most compared to other chemical types.

                        Many of the particular countries with very high chemical use, such as the ones noted above, have a high percentage of herbicide use, much like the overall United States. This may be due to the fact that this overall region accounts for much of the United States’s agricultural output, and therefore contributes significantly to the nation’s total herbicide use, making it the most used chemical nationally.

                        With regards to income, additional states that are interesting to analyze are South Dakota and Iowa. With these states, there are a fair amount of points above the national average that are marked relatively in the middle with regards to the state’s chemical use. Moreover, many countries below the national average income are noted with little chemical use in relation to the rest of the state. Other factors outside of agriculture and chemical use may explain this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With regards to types of chemicals used, many counties in Missouri, such as Webster county and Phelps county, and some counties in Texas, such as Erath county and Dallas county, are of interest as well. The leading type of chemical in these counties is fertilizer as opposed to herbicide or insecticide noted at the state level visualizations. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, this visualization demonstrates that the majority of counties in the middle strip of the United States follow the trend that the most popular chemical used in the agricultural industry is herbicide. Our hypothesis was mostly validated as well, since the majority of data points relating to personal income in all of these states known for agriculture or high chemical use fall below the national average personal income.
