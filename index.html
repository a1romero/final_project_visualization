                    In 2021, agriculture and its related industries made up 5.4% of the U.S. GDP, totalling to $1.264 trillion to the U.S. GDP. Additionally, farms provided $164.7 billion in this sum. Our project investigates these farms, the chemicals they use, and the amount of them they use. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The chemicals used by farms can be divided into two main categories, pesticides and fertilizers. The use of pesticides in agriculture is growing across the world. In fact, in 2017, it was estimated that three billion kilograms of pesticides are used every year worldwide. Moreover, the global crop protection market was estimated to be worth 78.7 billion dollars in 2022, an approximate 9.9% increase from the previous year.` Fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides all fall under the umbrella term of “pesticides,” which are pivotal in the growth of fruit, vegetables, and cereal grains. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We divided our data into four types of chemicals: fertilizers and the three subcategories of pesticides (fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides). We wanted to see if we could infer potential agricultural problems and the environmental effects of chemical use given a particular geographical area.

                    At a glance, the overall country uses herbicides the most in its agricultural industry, with insecticide and fertilizer trailing behind after a large margin of close to 700 million acres. This suggests that the most significant problem in the agricultural industry is the growth of weeds, and the most popular farming practice is row cropping. This is affirmed with the fact that in 2012, the USDA estimated that row cropping accounted for more than 75% of the total cropland in the United States.

                    The states specifically of note with regards to the amount of acres they treat with chemicals are Texas, Illinois, Iowa, and North Dakota. Texas specifically has a total of 159,168,231 acres treated with chemicals, Illinois has 163,743,200 acres, Iowa has 160,920,297 acres, and North Dakota has 141,551,022 acres. The leading agricultural crops in these states include cotton for Texas, corn for Illinois and Iowa, and wheat for North Dakota. In all of these states herbicide continues to be the largest portion of their chemical use, which can mean that these areas may suffer from undesirable vegetation and cause inhibited plant growth.

                <p>
                    The state with the highest amount of chemical use measured in acres treated is Illinois, with a value of 163,743, 200 acres, while the state with least is Alaska with 83910 acres treated. This appears appropriate, as Illinois is a key state in the agricultural industry, while Alaska’s climate makes it unsuitable for large amounts of farming.

                    Interesting states to take a look at are Florida, California, and Arizona. In these states the most popular type of chemical used is insecticide rather than herbicide like all the other states. This may be explained by their climates. Insects, rather than drinkgin water, obtain in through their food or can absorb it from their environment. Florida is well known for its humidity and high temperatures, both of which insects thrive in with the exception of extreme values. California and Arizona are also known for their high temperatures, which can possibly explain the need for more insecticides compared to herbicides.

                <p>
                    Another state of note is Minnesota due to its very high amount of acres treated with fertilizer, that being 14,641,179. While this may be explained by the total area of the state, the high fertilizer amount compared to the rest of the nation may also suggest a lack of nutrients in the soil. This could be caused by repeated farming over the same land since this state is located in the midwest region of the United States, which is associated with high agricultural output.

                    From first glance, it’s clear that there’s some correlation between the per capita personal income of a state and the amount of agricultural chemical usage. States with the highest number of acres treated consistently had per capita personal incomes hovering around the national average ($50,155.84). Most states below the national average also appear to have more acres treated than states above the national average. In general, states with lower personal income per capita tended towards treating more agricultural land with chemicals.

                    Overall, our hypothesis relating to poor populations and high chemical use was affirmed. Moreover, we found that areas with high chemical use tended to use herbicides the most to treat their crops, showing to us they suffer extensively from the effects of weeds. The high use of insecticides and fertilizers in the U.S., however, continues to be concerning due to the decrease in biodiversity and nutrient pollution they both cause respectively. If this project were to be expanded upon in the future, race could be another variable to analyze, as the case study we took as inspiration deals with minority communities.
