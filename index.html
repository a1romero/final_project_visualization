                    In 2021, agriculture and its related industries made up 5.4% of the U.S. GDP, totalling to $1.264 trillion to the U.S. GDP. Farms contributed $164.7 billion to this sum. Our project investigates these farms, the chemicals they use, and the amount of them they use.

                <p>
                    The chemicals used by farms can be divided into two main categories, pesticides and fertilizers. The use of pesticides in agriculture is growing across the world. In fact, in 2017, it was estimated that three billion kilograms of pesticides are used every year worldwide. Moreover, the global crop protection market was estimated to be worth 78.7 billion dollars in 2022, an approximate 9.9% increase from the previous year. Fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides all fall under the umbrella term of “pesticides,” which are pivotal in the growth of fruit, vegetables, and cereal grains. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We divided our data into four types of chemicals: fertilizers and the three subcategories of pesticides (fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides). We wanted to infer potential agricultural problems and the environmental effects of chemical use given a particular geographical area.
                </p>

                <u1>
                    <li><strong>Fungicides</strong> are used to address mold and disease, such as leaf spot, late blight, and fruit rot in food crops. Pollinators are an integral part of agriculture that are threatened by them. Over 150 food crops are dependent on these pollinators; in 2016, it was estimated that bees add $15 billion to crop values every year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Herbicides</strong> are used primarily in row crop farming, a method in which annual crops are planted in dense rows along farmland. They inhibit the growth of plants by affecting photosynthesis, amino acid production, and cell division, resulting in deformities. They can leak into bodies of water, leading to decreases in phytoplankton and specialized species populations. The endocrinological systems of some aquatic species can also be negatively impacted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insecticides</strong> are used to kill insects by targeting their nervous systems. It should be noted that the data we analyzed also dealt with nematicides, a type of pesticide targeting parasitic worms that possesses environmental toxicity. These chemicals can enter bodies of water through soil erosion and surface water runoff, and can result in deformities or death in many aquatic species. A well known insecticide is DDT, which is responsible for the thinning of eggshells in birds of prey species.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fertilizers</strong> are primarily composed of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium and are used to create nutrient-rich soil and promote plant growth. Organic variations include manure and crop residuals. However, extensive use of fertilizer can result in nutrient pollution. Excess nutrients in soil can enter surrounding bodies of water through surface water runoff, fueling the process of eutrophication and the eventual creation of dead zones.</li>

                    From first glance, it’s clear that there’s some correlation between the per capita personal income of a state and the amount of agricultural chemical usage. States with the highest number of acres treated consistently had per capita personal incomes hovering around the national average ($50,155.84). Most states below the national average also appear to have more acres treated than states above the national average. In general, states with lower personal income per capita tended towards treating more agricultural land with chemicals.

                    Overall, our hypothesis relating to poor populations and high chemical use was affirmed. Moreover, we found that areas with high chemical use tended to use herbicides the most to treat their crops, showing to us they suffer extensively from the effects of weeds. The high use of insecticides and fertilizers in the U.S., however, continues to be concerning due to the decrease in biodiversity and nutrient pollution they both cause respectively. If this project were to be expanded upon in the future, race could be another variable to analyze, as the case study we took as inspiration deals with minority communities.
