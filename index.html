                    In 2021, agriculture and its related industries made up 5.4% of the U.S. GDP, totalling to $1.264 trillion to the U.S. GDP. Farms contributed $164.7 billion to this sum. Our project investigates these farms, the chemicals they use, and the amount of them they use.

                <p>
                    The chemicals used by farms can be divided into two main categories, pesticides and fertilizers. The use of pesticides in agriculture is growing across the world. In fact, in 2017, it was estimated that three billion kilograms of pesticides are used every year worldwide. Moreover, the global crop protection market was estimated to be worth 78.7 billion dollars in 2022, an approximate 9.9% increase from the previous year. Fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides all fall under the umbrella term of “pesticides,” which are pivotal in the growth of fruit, vegetables, and cereal grains. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We divided our data into four types of chemicals: fertilizers and the three subcategories of pesticides (fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides). We wanted to infer potential agricultural problems and the environmental effects of chemical use given a particular geographical area.
                </p>

                <u1>
                    <li><strong>Fungicides</strong> are used to address mold and disease, such as leaf spot, late blight, and fruit rot in food crops. Pollinators are an integral part of agriculture that are threatened by them. Over 150 food crops are dependent on these pollinators; in 2016, it was estimated that bees add $15 billion to crop values every year.</li>
                    <li><strong>Herbicides</strong> are used primarily in row crop farming, a method in which annual crops are planted in dense rows along farmland. They inhibit the growth of plants by affecting photosynthesis, amino acid production, and cell division, resulting in deformities. They can leak into bodies of water, leading to decreases in phytoplankton and specialized species populations. The endocrinological systems of some aquatic species can also be negatively impacted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insecticides</strong> are used to kill insects by targeting their nervous systems. It should be noted that the data we analyzed also dealt with nematicides, a type of pesticide targeting parasitic worms that possesses environmental toxicity. These chemicals can enter bodies of water through soil erosion and surface water runoff, and can result in deformities or death in many aquatic species. A well known insecticide is DDT, which is responsible for the thinning of eggshells in birds of prey species.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fertilizers</strong> are primarily composed of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium and are used to create nutrient-rich soil and promote plant growth. Organic variations include manure and crop residuals. However, extensive use of fertilizer can result in nutrient pollution. Excess nutrients in soil can enter surrounding bodies of water through surface water runoff, fueling the process of eutrophication and the eventual creation of dead zones.</li>

                    At a glance, the country uses herbicides the most, with fertilizer and insecticide trailing behind after a margin of about 39 million and 166 million acres treated. This suggests that the most significant problem in the agricultural industry is the growth of weeds, and the most popular farming practice is row cropping (which utilizes herbicides frequently). In fact, in 2012, the USDA estimated that row cropping accounted for more than 75% of the total cropland in the United States. Due to the relatively small difference between herbicide and fertilizer use, the country may have poor soil health and its agricultural practices may contribute significantly to nutrient pollution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The states that use the most chemicals in agriculture are Iowa (55.1 million acres treated), Illinois (53.4 million acres treated), Texas (51.3 million), North Dakota (51.2 million), and Kansas (47.5 million). In 2022, each state’s most harvested crop was as follows: corn for Iowa, soybeans for Illinois, cotton for Texas, and wheat for North Dakota and Kansas. Herbicide continues to be the largest portion of the chemical use in these states, which can mean that they may suffer from undesirable vegetation. Through the use of herbicide, many plants in these states may experience inhibited growth. The states also follow national chemical use trends, with fertilizer and insecticide being the 2nd and 3rd most used chemicals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The state with the most chemical use measured in acres treated is Iowa, while the state with least is Rhode Island with 24,712 acres treated. This is appropriate, as Iowa is a key state in the agricultural industry, while land availability in Rhode Island makes it unsuitable for large-scale farming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vermont, Alaska, and Hawaii possess interesting deviations from the norm. In all of these states, the proportion of fertilizer use is noticeably higher than other chemical types. The poor soil health indicated by the fertilizer use may be due to the climates in Vermont and Alaska, since low soil temperatures decrease soil microbial activity. In the case of Hawaii, the same phenomenon could be explained by the size of the state and the potential repeated farming over the same land. Additionally, California has a higher proportion of insecticide than herbicide, making it another outlier compared to the overall country. This could be explained by California’s climate, since insects thrive in high temperatures. Further analysis of California is found <a href="about.html">here</a>.

                    From first glance, it’s clear that there’s some correlation between the per capita personal income of a state and the amount of chemicals it uses for agriculture. States with the highest number of acres treated with chemicals, such as Illinois and Iowa, consistently had per capita personal incomes hovering around the national average ($50,155.84). Most states below the national average also appear to have more acres treated than states above it, especially once they treated more than 15 million acres.

                    Most states with a total of less than 10 million acres, like Connecticut and Massachusetts, tended to have incomes higher than the national average. While many of these places are unsuitable for agriculture due to size and climate, they demonstrate that those who earn more than the national average are in areas with low chemical usage.

                    Overall, our hypothesis relating to poor populations and high chemical use was affirmed. Moreover, we found that areas with high chemical use tended to use herbicides the most to treat their crops, showing to us they suffer extensively from the effects of weeds. The high use of fertilizers and insecticides in the U.S., however, continues to be concerning due to the nutrient pollution and decrease in biodiversity and they both cause respectively. If this project were to be expanded upon in the future, race could be another variable to analyze, as the case study we took as inspiration deals with minority communities. For further analysis in an environmental context, the number of specialized species populations and oxygen levels in bodies of water could be included to help measure the effects of the chemicals used in agriculture.
